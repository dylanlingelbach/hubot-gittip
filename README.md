## hubot-gittip

A Hubot script for interacting with a shared Gittip account.

See `scripts/gittip.coffee` for full documentation.

### Sample Interaction

```
[7:42 PM] patcon: pantzbot gittip max

[7:42 PM] pantzbot: current max availability for weekly tips is $200.

[7:42 PM] patcon: pantzbot gittip giving

[7:42 PM] pantzbot: myplanetdigital is currently giving $0.00/week in
tips.

[7:43 PM] patcon: ok, just to kick it off: since this whole thing
wouldn't be possible without the gittip organization, I thought I'd tip
them first. Arbitrarily strarting with $10 of the $200 quota. It's not
mission critical at myplanet, but gittip seems obviously destined for
doing good things here :)

[7:43 PM] patcon: pantzbot gittip give Gittip 10

[7:43 PM] pantzbot: Now giving $10/week to Gittip.

[7:44 PM] patcon: pantzbot gittip tips

[7:44 PM] pantzbot: Listing tips given by myplanetdigital:

[7:44 PM] pantzbot: $10.00 => Gittip
```
